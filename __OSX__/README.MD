## You can delete this folder if you're not using MacOS.

Otherwise :

- ``` include ``` contains all of the CSFML 2.5.1 structures, types, functions and references in order to properly use CSFML.
- ``` lib ``` contains the built CSFML 2.5.1 library.

If you are NOT using an ARM M1 Mac but you ARE using an X86 Intel Mac, please download the CSFML source files from the official [SFML Website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) for the C binding in order to build the library by yourself.

This also applies if you want to use a different version of SFML or CSFML, or even to use it with another language.

The path where the library is built, on MacOS M1 (unsure for other versions) is in ``` /opt/homebrew/Cellar/csfml ``` (replace csfml by sfml or any other bindings).
